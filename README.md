# C-Language-Compiler-Design

 This project is aimed at implementing a compiler for the C programming language. It consists of three main components: a lexical analyzer, a syntax analyzer, and an intermediate code generator. Each component plays a crucial role in the compilation process, transforming human-readable C code into machine-executable instructions.

## Features
- Lexical analysis to tokenize source code into meaningful units (keywords, identifiers, constants, operators).
- Syntax analysis to validate the structure of the program according to C language grammar rules.
- Generation of intermediate code representations for efficient translation and optimization.

## Usages

 1.  Lexical Analyzer:

- Compile and run the lexical analyzer program.
- Provide the input C source code file.
- View the generated tokens and any lexical errors detected.

 2. Syntax Analyzer:
- Compile and run the syntax analyzer program.
- Pass the output of the lexical analyzer (tokens) as input.
- Check for syntax errors and view the parse tree if applicable.

3. Intermediate Code Generator:

- Compile and run the intermediate code generator program.
- View the generated intermediate code and perform optimizations if required.

## Future Enhancements:
- Integration of semantic analysis phase for type checking and symbol table management.
- Implementation of a code optimizer to further optimize the intermediate code.
- Addition of a code generator to translate the intermediate code into target machine code.
